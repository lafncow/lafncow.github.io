Welcome to my outlet for musings and experiments, I hope it is as enjoyable to read as it is to write.

My career path has led me from design to development to statistics. As a data scientist, I am able to draw on all 3 disciplines to solve problems. I am passionate about my work and my education.

I enjoy cooking, science fiction, traveling, beer, motorcycles, hiking, and my beautiful family.
