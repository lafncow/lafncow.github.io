As a data science manager for Deloitte Digital's Social Intelligence practice, I push the envelope in the application of social data. My experience includes 8 years of social data analysis, across a wide range of domains. I provide a holistic perspective to the data though my background in statistics, development, and graphic design. I am passionate about transforming data into understanding in a way that excites and enriches.
