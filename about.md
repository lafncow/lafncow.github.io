Welcome to my outlet for statistical musings and experiments, I hope it is as enjoyable to read as it is to write.

My career path has led me from design to development to statistics. I am able to draw on these 3 disciplines to solve problems and communicate results. I am passionate about my work and always finding something new to study. For the past 8 years, I have worked in social media research & analysis.

I enjoy cooking, science fiction, traveling, beer, motorcycles, hiking, and my beautiful family.
